# image-classification
classification of retinal disease with a CNN network.
implement a CNN network with residual blocks for determining whether a retinal picture is normal or has some diseases.
in the second stage we use a wider classifier with more neurons that results in more accuracy in the train set but lower in the test
in the third experiment we substitute 2 convolutional layer with one layer that have bigger kernel size but having same output size.
this results in reduced calculation efficiency with having more parameters to train and also lower accuracy, precision and recall.
